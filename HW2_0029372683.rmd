## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
#1 :
Credi card companies across the globe face lot of problem of issuing credit card to customers who don't pay payments on time, leading to extensive monetary loss to the organization. In this paper, sample data of credit card company based out of Taiwan was analysed and 6 different approaches are used to predict if customer would be qualified to get credit card or not.
The approaches used by the authors were : K-nearest neighbor qualifiers, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, Naïve Bayesian qualifier, artificial neural networks and classification trees. The variables used for analysis were amount of given credit, gender, education, marital status, age, past payment history, bill statement and previous payment.
#2:
In the business problem to identify whether or not credit card is given to qualified customer or not authors first analysed on what factors determine whether the customer is default customer or not.  After that they evaluated different statistical approaches to used for determining which is the right approach. In this case authors used 6 different techniques to figure out the right approach.
